> In my dive into the 8-week SQL challenge, I've had quite the journey. At the start, my SQL skills were pretty basic, mostly self-taught. But these projects changed the game. They helped me go beyond the basics, tackling trickier queries and getting cozy with those nifty window functions.  And they weren't just about SQL. These challenges opened a door to the whole business analysis world. I realized how powerful data can be for cracking business problems. It's been a step-by-step journey, it's fueled my love for solving problems with data.
