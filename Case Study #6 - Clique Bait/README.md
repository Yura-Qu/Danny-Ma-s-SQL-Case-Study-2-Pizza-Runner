### 1.2 How many cookies does each user have on average?
```sql
with CTE as(
select

from users
group by user_id
)

    round(avg(counts)) 
from CTE;
```

### 1.3 What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?

### 1.4 What is the number of events for each event type?

```sql
select 
    events.event_type,
    event_identifier.event_name,
    count(events.event_type) As counts
from events
join 
    event_identifier
where 
    events.event_type = event_identifier.event_type
group by 
    event_type,
    event_name
order by event_type;
```

### 1.5 What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?
```sql
select 
    count(distinct visit_id)/(select count(distinct visit_id) from events) *100 As percentage
from events
join 
    event_identifier
on 
    events.event_type = event_identifier.event_type
where 
    events.event_type = 3; 
```

### 1.6 What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?

```sql
with CTE as (
select 
    distinct visit_id,
    sum(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 AND page_id = 12 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS checkout,
    sum(CASE WHEN event_type = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase
FROM events
GROUP BY visit_id)
select 
    (1-(sum(purchase)/sum(checkout)))*100 as percentage 
from CTE;
```

> - `checkout`: viewed the page and and went to checkout 
>   - `event_type = 1` -- Page View
>   - `page_id = 12` -- Checkout
> - `purchase`:
>   - `event_type = 3 -- Purchase
> - `sum(purchase)/sum(checkout)` -- The percentage of visit which view the checkout page and have a purchase event
>   - Thus, `1 - (sum(purchase)/sum(checkout))` -- The percentage of visit which view the checkout page and dont have a purchase event

### 1.7 What are the top 3 pages by number of views? 

```sql
SELECT 
    events.page_id,
    page_hierarchy.page_name,
    COUNT(events.page_id) as counts
FROM events
JOIN page_hierarchy ON events.page_id = page_hierarchy.page_id
WHERE event_type = 1
GROUP BY events.page_id, page_hierarchy.page_name
ORDER BY counts DESC
LIMIT 3;
